New Website, New Values

My new website, refreshed projects, and posts now reflect who I am today and the values I hold. This website embodies my new appreciation for simplicity.

This latest iteration of my site is designed to be low-maintenance—exactly what I wanted. No overwhelming NPM dependencies, no chasing design trends. It’s a space to share my work, occasional thoughts, and interaction experiments when I find the time.
